### Assignment Tests


#### Work in the "C" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _4_ / _5_ :  The correct current transformation matrix is used for drawing each bone

    The multiplication order is reversed.

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _5_ / _5_ :  The child_root_transform is correctly set before the recursive call at the end of the function.

    


#### Work in the "B" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _4_ / _4_ :  Draw at least a stick fgure (e.g., line segment or cylinder) representation for the each bone

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _4_ / _4_ :  Four additional special motions are defined, loaded, trimmed, and then played.

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _2_ / _2_ :  Motions smoothly transition from the ballet dancerâ€™s base loop motion into all of these special motions whenever a new motion is played.

    


#### Work in the "A" Range

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _4_ / _4_ :  QuickShapes are used to draw simple geometries like spheres, cubes, cylinders, cones, etc..

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _3_ / _3_ :  Transformation matrices (Matrix4s) are used to apply scales, translations, and rotations to the model matrix.

    

+ :heavy_check_mark:  _3_ / _3_ :  Colors and several geometries are used to make a convincing character.

    Nice work!!!
